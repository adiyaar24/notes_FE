  - pages
    - Next.js auto-generated routes
  - services
    - This directory is used to store services or utility functions that interact with external APIs, handle data fetching, or perform other business logic. It helps keep your code organized and separates concerns.
  - styles
    - Global styles, styling variables, utility classes
  - types
    - TypeScript type definitions.This helps with static type checking and enhances code readability.
